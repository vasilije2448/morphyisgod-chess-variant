1. Placement phase
    1.1 Start with an empty board. When a player clicks on a piece and then on the board, the piece should appear on the board. No rules are necessary at this stage, just make the pieces appear on the board. Don't add any elements to the side of the chessboard. Make any GUI elements either above or bellow the chessboard so that it's mobile friendly.
    1.2 Allow only placement of pieces that are in accordance with the rules specified in GAME_SPECIFICATION.md
2. Standard chess phase
