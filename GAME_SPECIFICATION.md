The game begins with an EMPTY board, except for white king which is placed randomly somewhere on the first 2 rows and the black king which is placed randomly somewhere on the last 2 rows. The players alternate placing pieces and pawns on the board. The 9 squares surrounding the king are his safe squares (squares your opponent may not place a piece). For example, if the king is on d1, his nine squares are d1-3,c1-3,e1-3. If he is on a1, its a1-3,b1-3,c1-3. You may NOT place your opponent in check.

Move 2 will ALWAYS be a pawn move, and move 3 will ALWAYS be a piece move (you get the idea). Pawns may only be placed (3) or more squares away from the queening rank (so 2, 3, 4, 5 for white, 4, 5, 6, 7 for black). Pawns are LIMITED to ONE per file, however, you may place two pawns on a file if you do not have the ability to place it on its own file* (this may happen, sometimes all squares are taken on a file).

You  may only have 1 bishop of each color (i.e. 1 light squared and 1 dark squared). There is no castling. En Passant exists.

After the placing of the pieces is completed, a game of chess commences! (White moves first)
