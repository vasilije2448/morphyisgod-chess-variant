We're making a simple web app for the chess variant described in GAME_SPECIFICATION.md. The app should use vue3-chessboard  TheChessboard component and the chess.js library. It only needs to support a single player game mode where the user controls both the white and black pieces. Read VUE3_CHESSBOARD_DOCS.md to understand how TheChessboard works. Start by implementing only section 1.1 of PLAN.md.
